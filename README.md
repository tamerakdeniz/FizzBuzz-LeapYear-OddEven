# Basic Python Programs Collection

A collection of three basic Python programs demonstrating fundamental programming concepts.

## Programs

### 1. FizzBuzz
- File: `fizzbuzz.py`
- Counts up to a given number and prints:
  - "Fizz" for multiples of 3
  - "Buzz" for multiples of 5
  - "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5
  - The number itself otherwise

### 2. Leap Year Checker
- File: `leapyear.py`
- Determines if a given year is a leap year
- Uses the standard leap year rules:
  - Year divisible by 4
  - Century years must be divisible by 400

### 3. Odd or Even Checker
- File: `odd_or_even.py`
- Determines if a given number is odd or even

## Usage

Run any program using Python 3:
```bash
python fizzbuzz.py
python leapyear.py
python odd_or_even.py
```

## Error Handling

All programs include:
- Input validation
- Type checking
- User-friendly error messages

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
